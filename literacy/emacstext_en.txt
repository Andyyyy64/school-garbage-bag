What kind of image do you have of the University of Aizu? People often say,"it is a university specialized in computers,isn't it?" It is true that we teach computer science itself and research on the topic.However,to be more precise, we teach and research Information and Communication Technologies（ICT）which uses computers as a tool.
ICT inckudes a wide variety of fields such as AI,robotics,the Internet,IoT,and big data.which are featured in the newsoaoers and on TV every day. The university of Aizu has recently been highly regarded.earning higj postions both in domestic and international university rankings.Especially,our globalization has received high praise.The main reason for this is straightforward:Around 40% of all our faculty members are foreign nationals nad our official languages are English and japanese.Our internal emails and notifications usually start with the English versions followed by the Japanese versions. In addition, many foreign faculty members teach specialized skills in English. Further, a few years ago, we started accepting students who graduated from high schools abroad by establishing a program to allow students to graduate from the university only taking courses provided in English. At our university, English is just a tool for communication. Computers are the same. Except for faculty members and students studying the mechanism of computers themselves, computers are merely a tool for us. Students and faculty members from around the world work hard to improve themselves through friendly competition in order to create new principles and services of ICT by studying advanced ICT with English and computers as tools.
